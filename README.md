## Covid Lead

As this pandemic is hitting everyone so hard and people are losing their lives due to unavailability of covid-resources (such as oxygen cylinders, ventilators, beds etc).
Covid Lead shows you the list of available sources along with the address and contact info. (When completed, all the sources shown would be 95% credible.)

Features:
1. You can look for resources based on the resource's name, city, state.
2. In case you have a lead, you get the option to add it to the database.
3. (still working on it) An Upvote and Downvote feature - which will let people upvote and downvote the source based on its credibility.
Sources with negative score will be removed automatically.

I hope this project helps out the people in need. 
I will try to finish it as soon as possible so it's production ready in no time.
